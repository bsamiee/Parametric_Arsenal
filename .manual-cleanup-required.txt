MANUAL CLEANUP REQUIRED
=======================

The following files need to be manually deleted from the repository:

1. COMPLIANCE_VERIFICATION.md - Documentation file not needed in final commit
2. TEST_REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md - Documentation file not needed in final commit
3. test/core/Results/ResultMonadTests.cs - Replaced by ResultAlgebraTests.cs
4. test/core/Results/ResultFactoryTests.cs - Replaced by ResultAlgebraTests.cs

These files have been added to .gitignore to prevent them from being tracked going forward.

To remove them from git history, run:
  git rm COMPLIANCE_VERIFICATION.md
  git rm TEST_REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md
  git rm test/core/Results/ResultMonadTests.cs
  git rm test/core/Results/ResultFactoryTests.cs
  git commit -m "Remove documentation files and obsolete test files"
  git push

After deletion, the test structure will be:
- test/core/Results/ - 2 files: ResultAlgebraTests.cs, ResultEdgeCaseTests.cs, ResultGenerators.cs (3 total)
- test/rhino/ - 1 file: RhinoGeometryTests.cs
